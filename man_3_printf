.SH NAME
printf \- (print formatted) formatted output conversion.
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <stdio.h>
.PP
int _printf(const char *format, ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The _printf function prints a message on the screen using a formatted string that. It includes the instructions to mix multiple chains in the final chain to be displayed on the screen. It is a special function because it receives a variable number of parameters, the first parameter is fixed and is the format string. Through this function we can write data to the standard output device, being any combination of numerical values, single characters and character strings.
.PP
\fBReturn value\fp
.PP
After a successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to finalize the output to the strings).
.PP
\fBThe characters of the flag\fp
.PP
The% character is followed by zero or more of the following flags:
# #
The value must be converted to an "alternative form". For conversions or,
the first character of the output string is set to zero (putting a 0 if it was no longer zero).
For x and X conversions, a nonzero result has the string "0x" (or "0X" for X conversions) before it.
For conversions to, A, e, E, f, F, g and G, the result will always contain a decimal point.
For g and Conversions G, the final zeros are not removed from the result as they would be otherwise.
For other conversions, the result is undefined.
.PP
\fBFormat string format\fp
.PP
The formatters allow to be modified to define number of digits or characters,
entering the parameters for the number of digits and significant digits

.PP
\fBType field characters\fp
.PP
c	Character	When used with printf functions, specifies a single-byte character; when used with wprintf functions, specifies a wide character.
.PP
_printf("imprimir caracter: %c", 'c');
.PP
d	Integer	Signed decimal integer.
.PP
_printf("imprimir decimal: %d", 31);
.PP
i	Integer	Signed decimal integer.
.PP
_printf("imprimir entero: %i", 2);
.PP
s	String	When used with printf functions, specifies a single-byte or multi-byte character string; when used with wprintf functions, specifies a wide-character string. Characters are displayed up to the first null character or until the precision value is reached.
.PP
_printf("imprimir string: %s", "soy un string");
